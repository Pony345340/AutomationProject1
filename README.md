# AutomationProject1
#Created Automation Project using Selenium Webdriver by Python Language. (If possible run the project using Pycharm IDE)
#Using Config.txt file one defined link will be open in Chrome browser
#It will navigate to https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/selenium-tutorial/selenium-cheat-sheet/ one by one by clicking event
#Then one PDF(https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Selenium-Cheat-Sheet-2022.pdf) will be opened in a new tab
#It will be downloaded in the defined folder location (i have used the project location where it will be set in the local and run)
#After downloading successfully it will verify if that PDF file downloaded in the defined path or not
#N.B: Faced one issue in the https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/selenium-tutorial/ page where left panel was not loading properly so did a right click to appear that left panel

#Here, i didn't use any 𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬,𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐱𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 and 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐬 - 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬

#Save both .py & .txt file in your local and run
